### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a principal technical product manager in the Microsoft Azure networking team. I enjoy validation and verification of cloud architectures and playing with open source software.

:cyclone: most of my content is in the [az-pattern](https://github.com/fabferri/az-pattern) repository
